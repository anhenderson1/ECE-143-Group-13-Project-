## Project Overview

This project explores how everyday lifestyle factors – including diet type, workout behavior, and basic demographics – relate to overall health and energy expenditure.

Using a Kaggle Lifestyle dataset (20,000 workout records plus meal metadata), we:

- Perform exploratory data analysis and visualizations
- Analyze correlations between lifestyle variables and health/fitness metrics
- Train a Random Forest classifier to predict calorie burn categories:
  **Low, Medium, High, Very High**
- Interpret feature importance to identify which factors matter most

The final outcome combines visual storytelling and statistical insights to highlight how data-driven analysis can support healthier lifestyle choices.
